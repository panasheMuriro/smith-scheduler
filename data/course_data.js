In addition to typical archives of texts and other historical remnants created by people, environmental historians also avail themselves to “natural” archives, including the ice core, tree-ring, and lake sediment samples collected by climate scientists. Topics in this course will include historical conceptions of nature and the natural world, human settlement, human/animal relations, disaster, agrarian development, the adoption of carbon energy, social movements centered on the environment and environmentalism, and discussions of the Anthropocene.

Through these units, students will ask: what human desires animate our relationship with media? For what purposes have people invented and evolved these technologies? How do makers use them, and what are audiences seeking in them? These questions will help students see the fundamental forces that unite film, television, video games and Internet media alongside the elements that distinguish them from each other.

How did 70- through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle? The course examines the WPA interviews as historical sources by studying scholarship that relies heavily on them. Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slavery.

Specific topics include solutions to first order equations and linear systems, existence and uniqueness of solutions, nonlinear systems and linear stability analysis, forcing and resonance, Laplace transforms.

The prevalent ‘contagion’ frame is a story about seeing the microbe as the enemy, erasing or downplaying human agency and practices (especially the expansion into new ecosystems), and affirming epidemiology and medical science as the only solution. The frame carries over into politics and culture and provides a way to translate the science of contagious disease into social terms that influence the public and also public policy. This frame and others are used to explore past and current pandemics.Enrollment limited to 40.\n\nCrosslist(s): HSC","course_enforced_requirements":""}},{"course_surface_data":{"course_dept_name":"PHI","course_dept_link":"http://catalog.smith.edu/index.php?dept=PHI","course_subject":"PHI","course_number":"225","course_section":"01","course_title":"Continental Philosophy ","course_title_link":"https://www.smith.edu/apps/course_search/#phi-225-01-202401","course_instructor":"Susan Levin","course_section_status":"(Open)"},"course_deep_data":{"course_credits":"Credits: 4","course_max_enrollment":"Max Enrollment: 999","course_type":"Course Type: Lecture","course_section_enrollment":"Section Enrollment: 17","course_grade_mode":"Grade Mode: Graded","course_waitlist_count":"","course_reserved_seats":"Reserved Seats: No","course_curriculum_distribution":"Curriculum Distribution: Historical Studies","course_time_and_location":{"location":"","time":{"Wednesday":"2:45 PM - 4:00 PM","Monday":"3:05 PM - 4:20 PM"}},"course_instructional_method":"Instructional Method: In-Person","course_description_detail":"This course provides a survey of major figures and developments in continental philosophy.

What might the reality or unreality of the self mean for the nature of the human experience, for ethics or for what gives lives meaning? These are questions that have been raised and addressed with great sophistication in both Indian and Western philosophical traditions, and that have been explored empirically in cognitive psychology and by experimental philosophers.

Topics include the history of Romance languages, how to teach grammar and vocabulary, the role of instructors and feedback techniques. The critical framing provided will help students look at schools as cultural sites, centers of immigration and globalization. Class observations and scholarly readings help students understand the importance of research in the shaping of the pedagogical practice of world languages. Prerequisite: At least 4 semesters (or placement to equivalent level) of a Romance language taught at Smith (Italian, Portuguese, Spanish or French).

What systems and institutions (e.g. white supremacy, settler colonialism, binary gender, ableism, late-stage capitalism, the carceral state) do queer and trans epistemologies slate for demolition or destruction? Should certain structures (e.g. medical, educational, political, scientific, housing) and relationships (e.g. platonic, romantic, sexual, caregiving, community) be repaired or renovated? What needs to be built from scratch or salvaged from existing resources to ensure sustainable, accessible, non-violent, joyful modes of living? We draw on queer, trans, Black feminist, critical disability and feminist science studies blueprints for world-building. Enrollment limited to 12. Juniors and seniors only.
